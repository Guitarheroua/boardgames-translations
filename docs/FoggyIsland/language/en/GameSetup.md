## Basic Game Setup

***

- Each player gets a pile of tokens with similar shields color on the back. (With red shields for one player, with blue - for another.)

***

- Each player should divide his pile of tokens for two smaller piles: [basic characters](BasicCharactersDescription.md) (18 tokens) and [mercenary characters](MercenaryCharactersDescription.md) (12 tokens)

> Note: If you play Basic Game, you do not need [mercenary characters tokens](MercenaryCharactersDescription.md). Return them back to the box.

***

- Take 5 tokens from the pile with [basic characters](BasicCharactersDescription.md). Do not show tokens to your opponent
