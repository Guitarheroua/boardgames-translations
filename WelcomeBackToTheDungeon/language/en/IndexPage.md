*The sun is shining in the Abysmal Woods where you’re strolling without a care in the world, your weapon at your belt, dreams of adventure in your head. On your path, you stop before a damaged dungeon door. It seems that great battles took place here, a sure sign of coveted treasure inside. You recognize this dungeon from the ballads sung in your village! However, you’re not the only one who wants to enter, despite the warnings left around the entrance by the previous adventurers. Will you muster your courage to break open the door or will you
let your opponents brave the monsters found inside? Let the adventure begin!*

## Overview and Goal of the Game

**Welcome Back to the Dungeon** plays over several rounds during which one hero enters the dungeon with a set of equipment. Each turn, add
monsters to the dungeon, remove equipment from the hero, or decide to pass for the round. The last person in the bidding must enter the dungeon and face all the monsters put inside during the round, with what little equipment the adventurer has left. Successfully traverse two Dungeons to win the game, or be the last player left in the game after the other players are eliminated.
