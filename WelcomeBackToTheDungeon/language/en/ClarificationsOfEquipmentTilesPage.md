## Elvish Harp

As long as your HP is less than 5, all odd-strength Monsters you face only deal 1 damage and all even-strength Monsters only deal 2 damage. This damage can be reduced even further by the [Charming Flute](#charming-flute).

![harp]

***

## Lucky Coin

You can ignore an even-strength Monster and keep the Lucky Coin. If the next Monster you face is also even-strength **and is not defeated by another piece of Equipment,** defeat it and continue this way until you face an odd-strength Monster. The Lucky Coin is then discarded.

> Example: You face a Vampire with strength 4 and choose to ignore it with the Lucky Coin. Then, you face the Demon with strength 7 and choose to use your Dancing Sword to defeat it. You can continue to use your Coin: if the next Monster is even-strength, defeat it. However, if the next Monster is odd-strength and you canâ€™t defeat it with another piece of Equipment, you must discard your Lucky Coin.

![coin]

***

## Charming Flute

Defeat Goblins. For each Goblin you defeat this way, the Bard reduces damage dealt by the next Monsters by 1. As with the Princessâ€™s [Family Crown](#family-crown), the identity of the Monster doesnâ€™t change.

> Example: A Vampire stays a Vampire, an even Monster with strength 4, even if the damage taken is reduced by the Charming Flute.

***

## Royal Scepter

The second Monster of each kind is defeated, even if the first Monster of the same identity was defeated (they just need to be in the Dungeon). If there is a third Monster (ie. Special Monster) of the same identity in the Dungeon, it is ignored as well.

![scepter]

***

## Greatsword

Before entering the Dungeon, choose another player at the table, whether they are still in play or have been eliminated.

![sword]

***

## Family Crown

Damage is reduced by 2, but the identity of the Monster does not change.

> Example: A Vampire only does 2 points of damage, but remains a Vampire.

![crown]

***

## Reanimation Bones

The Reanimation Bones can be used multiple times. If you gain HP (from the Bloody Wand and/or the Possession Scroll), you can use the Reanimation Bones again when you die. If your HP is 1 when you die, you cannot use the Reanimation Bones.

![bones]

***

## Smoke Bomb

You cannot discard the Smoke Bomb. If the Smoke Bomb is the only equipment left under the Adventurer, you cannot use it.

![bomb]
