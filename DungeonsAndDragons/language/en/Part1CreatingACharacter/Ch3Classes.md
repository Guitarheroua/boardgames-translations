Adventurers are extraordinary people, driven by a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can’t stand against.

Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It’s more than a profession; it’s your character’s calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the multiverse. A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant in a god’s unfolding plan or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and devotees who share his faith.

Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a fighter’s mastery of weapons and armor, and a wizard’s spells. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing features often improve. Each class entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every level, and a detailed explanation of each one.

Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one class. A rogue might switch direction in life and dabble in the cleric class while continuing to advance as a rogue. Elves are known to combine martial mastery with magical training and advance as fighters and wizards simultaneously. Optional rules for combining classes in this way, called multiclassing, can be found in the *Player’s Handbook*.

Four basic classes - listed in the Classes table - are found in almost every D&D world and define most typical adventurers. See the *Player’s Handbook* for information about other classes.

## Classes

## Cleric

Arms and eyes upraised toward the sun and a prayer on his lips, an elf begins to glow with an inner light that spills out to heal his battle-worn companions.

Chanting a song of glory, a dwarf swings his axe in wide swaths to cut through the ranks of orcs arrayed against him, shouting praise to the gods with every foe’s fall.

Calling down a curse upon the forces of undeath, a human lifts her holy symbol as light pours from it to drive back the zombies crowding in on her companions.

Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a cleric is imbued with divine magic.

### Healers and Warriors

Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the
gods, flowing from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power, manifesting it as miraculous effects.
The gods don’t grant this power to everyone who seeks it,
but only to those chosen to fulfill a high calling.

Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or training. A cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient
rites, but the ability to cast cleric spells relies on devotion
and an intuitive sense of a deity’s wishes.

Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes.
They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague
or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit
most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their
combat training to let them wade into melee with the
power of the gods on their side.

### Divine Agents

Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a
cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple
service, carrying out their gods’ will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office, viewed as a
stepping stone to higher positions of authority and involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare
in most hierarchies.

When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually
because his or her god demands it. Pursuing the goals
of the gods often involves braving dangers beyond the
walls of civilization, smiting evil or seeking holy relics in
ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to protect
their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations,
or sealing a portal that would allow a demon prince to
enter the world.

Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to
established temples and orders of their faiths. A temple
might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a high priest might be in a
position to demand it.

### Creating a Cleric

As you create a cleric, the most important question to
consider is which deity to serve and what principles you
want your character to embody. The *Player’s Handbook*
includes lists of many of the gods of the multiverse.
Check with your DM to learn which deities are in
your campaign.

Once you’ve chosen a deity, consider your cleric’s relationship to that god. Did you enter this service willingly?
Or did the god choose you, impelling you into service
with no regard for your wishes? How do the temple
priests of your faith regard you: as a champion or a troublemaker? What are your ultimate goals? Does your deity
have a special task in mind for you? Or are you striving to
prove yourself worthy of a great quest?

#### Quick Build

You can make a cleric quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score,
followed by Strength or Constitution. Second, choose the
acolyte background.

## Class Features

As a cleric, you gain the following class features.

### Hit Points

**Hit Dice:** 1d8 per cleric level
**Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
**Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your
Constitution modifier per cleric level after 1st

### Proficiencies

**Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields
**Weapons:** Simple weapons
**Tools:** None
**Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Charisma
**Skills:** Choose two from History, Insight, Medicine, Persuasion, and Religion

### Equipment

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the
equipment granted by your background:

- *(a)* a mace or *(b)* a warhammer (if proficient)
- *(a)* scale mail, *(b)* leather armor, or *(c)* chain mail (if proficient)
- *(a)* a light crossbow and 20 bolts or *(b)* any simple weapon
- *(a)* a priest’s pack or *(b)* an explorer’s pack
- A shield and a holy symbol

### Spellcasting

As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.
See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and
chapter 11 for a selection of cleric spells.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from
the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips
of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips
Known column of the Cleric table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to
cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one
of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level
or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for
you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you
do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell).
The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four
1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of
16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of
1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the
1st-level spell *cure wounds*, you can cast it using a 1stlevel or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it
from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you
finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells
requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1
minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells.
The power of your spells comes from your devotion to
your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell
refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use
your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw
DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack
roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a holy symbol (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.

### Divine Domain

Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge,
Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life
domain is detailed at the end of the class description and
provides examples of gods associated with it. See the
*Player’s Handbook* for details on all the domains.

Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you
additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain
that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th,
8th, and 17th levels.

#### Domain Spells

Each domain has a list of spells - its domain spells - that
you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it
prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of
spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the
cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

### Channel Divinity

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy
directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical
effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and
an effect determined by your domain. Some domains
grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as
noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which
effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest
to use your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.
When you use such an effect from this class, the DC
equals your cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you
can use it three times between rests. When you finish a
short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.

#### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a
prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see
or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom
saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is
turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move
to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or
try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.
If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the
Dodge action.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your
choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your
choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score
above 20 using this feature.

### Destroy Undead

Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving
throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is
instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a
certain threshold, as shown in the Destroy Undead table.

**Destroy Undead**

| **Cleric Level** | **Destroys Undead of CR...** |
| :--------------- | ---------------------------: |
| 5th              |                 1/2 or lower |
| 8th              |                   1 or lower |
| 11th             |                   2 or lower |
| 14th             |                   3 or lower |
| 17th             |                   4 or lower |

### Divine Intervention

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile
dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your
cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the
nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or
cleric domain spell would be appropriate.

If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again
for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no roll required.

## Divine Domains

In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different
aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s
domain. All the domains over which a deity has influence
are called the deity’s portfolio. For example, the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of
Knowledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you choose one
aspect of your deity’s portfolio to emphasize, and you are
granted powers related to that domain.

Your choice might correspond to a particular sect
dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be
worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”) Apollo,
emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in
a different place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”), emphasizing his association with the Life domain. Alternatively,
your choice of domain could simply be a matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals
to you most.

Each domain’s description gives examples of deities
who have influence over that domain. Gods are included
from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk,
Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings, as well as
from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons of
antiquity.

### Life Domain

The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy - one of the fundamental forces of the universe - that
sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and
health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for
those in need, and driving away the forces of death and
undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence
over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such
as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as
Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing
or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and
Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as
Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

#### Bonus Proficiency

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

#### Disciple of Life

Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more
effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher
to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains
additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.

#### Channel Divinity: Preserve Life

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
to heal the badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke
healing energy that can restore a number of hit points
equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures
within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among
them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than
half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature
on an undead or a construct.

#### Blessed Healer

Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on
others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level
or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than
you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.

#### Divine Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to
the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.

#### Supreme Healing

Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one
or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead
use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a creature, you
restore 12.
