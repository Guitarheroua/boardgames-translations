## Game end

[Basic Game](GamePlay.md#basic-game) and [Game with Weather Cards](GamePlay.md#game-with-weather-cards) ends after 2 rounds.

[Game with Mercenary Characters](GamePlay.md#game-with-mercenary-characters) ends after 4 rounds.

## Scoring

Player scores all horizontal, vertical and diagonal [lines](ComponentsAndTerminologyPage.md#the-line) of his color by next rules:

| Number of Tokens in Line | Number of Victory Points |
|-|-|
|3|3|
|4|5|
|5|7|
|6|10|

### Character scoring clarification

* If character token builds a couple lines, it scores in each of this lines
* If 2 [Pig Traders](BasicCharactersDescription.md#pig-trader) builds one line, victory points are doubled (ignore one Pig ability).
* If [Pig Trader](BasicCharactersDescription.md#pig-trader) and [Cat Aristocrat](MercenaryCharactersDescription.md#cat-aristocrat) build one line, victory points are tripled (ignore Pig ability).
* If [Pig Trader](BasicCharactersDescription.md#pig-trader), [Cat Aristocrat](MercenaryCharactersDescription.md#cat-aristocrat), and [Crow King](MercenaryCharactersDescription.md#crow-king) build one line, use Cat and Pig abilities first, and then Crow ability.
