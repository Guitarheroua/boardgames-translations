## Game with Mercenary Characters

Use all rules and setup, that described in ["Basic Game"](#basic-game) and ["Game with Weather Cards"](#game-with-weather-cards). Additionally use setup described in ["Extended Game Setup: With Mercenary Characters"](GameSetup.md#extended-game-setup-with-mercenary-characters).

### Clarification about characters

1. Players should apply ability of mercenary character when placing token face up (happened on Sunny or Cloudy weather).
2. Players cannot apply ability of mercenary character when placing token face down (happened on Foggy weather). Exceptions are [Pig Trader](BasicCharactersDescription.md#pig-trader), [Cat Aristocrat](MercenaryCharactersDescription.md#cat-aristocrat), and [Crow King](MercenaryCharactersDescription.md#crow-king), their abilities work as usual.

### Additional round rules

1. After scoring points, players get coins equal to the number of victory points.
2. Players may hire mercenary character, exchanging basic character and pay a needed cost. (Costs described in ["Mercenary Characters Description"](MercenaryCharactersDescription.md) page).
3. Players add hired mercenary characters to their character piles.
    > Note: The number of character tokens in player pile should always be equal 18, that's why players must exchange their basic character tokens to mercenary character tokens.

> Note: Game lasts 4 rounds. The winner of the game is the player who scores more coins. If there is a tie, players count the cost of all hired mercenary characters. If still a tie, players should play an additional round.
