Foggy Island is the fantasy world full of adventures and surprises.

The race for power was never so interesting and exciting.

For whom is this game? This is a nice family or duel game, that is based on a "Tic-Tac-Toe" game mechanic. It gives you the possibility to show your logical thinking and strategic skills. Each player`s army consists of 18 characters. They create lines which bring victory points. But beware of spies sneaking everywhere and help your opponent. Let's start the Adventure!
